# Summary

The demand for data science skills is surging due to a rise in the use of AI and Machine Learning across industries. To meet this demand, the University of Toronto is looking to customize its courses to better suit the skills being demanded by industry. 

By leveraging the power of data analytics to determine exactly what employers are looking for, the MIE1624 curriculum was redesigned, a new masterâ€™s program was developed, and a utility to help engineering students select courses was produced. 

The redesigned MIE1624 incorporates big data science and tools, as well as practical experience with Tableau. This improves its generalizability while maintaining a reasonable degree of depth for each subject that it engages with. The redesigned course better suits more jobs than any other single course surveyed from world leading analytics programs. With this course, engineering students will be prepared to acquire and excel in a data science position in any industry.

Using industry data, clusters of in demand skills were identified and directly matched to course curriculums to build a new program: the Masters of Business Analytics and Engineering. This program will produce industry leaders as students will graduate with practical experience in all sought after technical skills, with strong experience building the in-demand soft skills.

For students seeking an emphasis in analytics as part of the Masters of Engineering, a new utility has been developed that will help them select courses to enter the career of their choice. By inputting a job posting from Indeed, skills are extracted and matched to courses. The courses provided by the utility will meet the top skills of the position, and the algorithm has been equipped with a feature to ensure diversification of the skills.
